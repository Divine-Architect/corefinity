CURSOR PROMPT — SECTION: “Managed hosting designed for performance, stability, and scale.”

You are updating the Corefinity homepage to add the next content band after the Key Features section.

0. Scope

You may edit:

index.html

css/styles.css

Do NOT touch:

Header / announcement bar / nav

Hero / hero video

Brand marquee (.cf-brands)

Performance note (.cf-performance-note)

Existing .cf-key-features section (except to find insertion point)

No JavaScript changes. This section must be pure HTML + CSS.

1. Placement in index.html

Find the Key Features section:

<section class="cf-key-features">
  ...
</section>


Immediately after the closing </section> of .cf-key-features and before whatever comes next, insert a new section with the following structure:

<section class="cf-managed-hosting">
  <div class="cf-managed-inner">
    <header class="cf-managed-head">
      <h2 class="cf-managed-title">
        Managed hosting designed for performance, stability, and scale.
      </h2>
      <p class="cf-managed-intro">
        Corefinity reduces the operational drag around high-traffic commerce workloads. We combine tuned
        infrastructure, proactive monitoring, and hands-on support so your team can focus on shipping,
        not firefighting.
      </p>
    </header>

    <div class="cf-managed-grid">
      <!-- Pillar 1 -->
      <article class="cf-managed-block">
        <div class="cf-managed-block-icon" aria-hidden="true">
          <!-- you may use an inline SVG or an existing icon that fits the theme -->
        </div>
        <h3 class="cf-managed-block-title">Performance-first architecture</h3>
        <p class="cf-managed-block-body">
          Environments are tailored for PHP, Laravel, and Magento: right-sized PHP-FPM pools, Redis,
          queues, and databases that are tuned for real buying journeys instead of synthetic benchmarks.
        </p>
        <ul class="cf-managed-block-list">
          <li>Optimised PHP-FPM and worker configurations</li>

      <article class="cf-managed-block">
        <div class="cf-managed-block-icon" aria-hidden="true">

        <h3 class="cf-managed-block-title">Stability under real peak load</h3>
        <p class="cf-managed-block-body">
          Campaigns, product drops, and seasonal peaks are planned events, not outages. Capacity,
          health checks, and fail-safes are aligned with your calendar, not just CPU graphs.

        <ul class="cf-managed-block-list">

      <article class="cf-managed-block">
        <div class="cf-managed-block-icon" aria-hidden="true">
          <!-- icon -->

        <h3 class="cf-managed-block-title">Built to scale with your roadmap</h3>
        <p class="cf-managed-block-body">
          As teams, traffic, and channels grow, environments evolve with you. New regions, stores,
          and services can be added without re-platforming or re-architecting from scratch.

        <ul class="cf-managed-block-list">
          <li>Environment patterns that scale from pilot to flagship</li>

        </ul>
      </article>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


You may add small additional wrapper divs inside this section if it helps alignment, but do not change the semantic meaning (section/header/article).

2. Visual & Layout Intent (CSS in styles.css)

Add new styles at the bottom of css/styles.css for:

.cf-managed-hosting

.cf-managed-inner

.cf-managed-head

.cf-managed-title

.cf-managed-intro

.cf-managed-grid

.cf-managed-block

.cf-managed-block-icon

.cf-managed-block-title

.cf-managed-block-body

.cf-managed-block-list

You have styling freedom, but must follow these constraints:

2.1 Section feel

This band should feel like a calm, premium, explanatory section, visually softer than the highly animated Performance card above it.

Use existing theme tokens for colors, typography, spacing, and shadows; do not introduce off-brand colors.

Background:

Use a subtle variation of the existing page backgrounds (e.g. a slightly lighter/darker blend of bg-2 / bg-3), possibly with a very soft gradient or radial glow that ties into the hero.

Padding:

Vertical: approximately in the 72–104px range (you choose exact values to fit overall rhythm).

Horizontal: align with whatever container width and padding the hero / key features section uses.

2.2 Heading & intro

Center the section heading and intro within .cf-managed-head.

Constrain the intro text to a readable width (around 560–680px) and center it.

Title should match the visual weight of other H2s in the page (.cf-key-features-title etc.), using --text-primary.

Intro uses --text-secondary and slightly smaller font-size.

2.3 Grid layout

.cf-managed-grid should show three horizontal pillars on desktop, each of equal width.

Use CSS grid or flex; choose the method that best matches the existing layout system.

On medium screens, stack into 2 + 1 or all 3 in a single column, whatever looks most harmonious with the rest of the site.

On small/mobile, stack the three blocks vertically with consistent gaps.

Spacing guidance (you choose exact values to maintain harmony):

Gap between the three blocks: ~24–32px.

Vertical spacing inside each block should follow a clear rhythm (e.g. overline/icon → title → body → list).

2.4 Block styling

Each .cf-managed-block should:

Look like a refined content panel, not a heavy card.

Use a softer background than the Key Features cards (e.g. a lightly elevated panel).

Use border-radius consistent with other cards on the page.

Have subtle shadow and/or border that feels in-family with the rest of the design.

Use typography and spacing that read comfortably as 2–3 short paragraphs per block.

You may:

Use a very subtle vertical gradient or inner highlight.

Use a thin border plus a very soft glow shadow.

Use understated icon “auroras” or light glows behind the icon container.

2.5 Icons

For .cf-managed-block-icon:

You may either:

Reuse existing SVG icons from assets/icons/ if any are suitable, OR

Use simple inline SVG line icons that match the style of existing icons.

Icon size should be modest (e.g. 24–32px), not oversized.

Optionally wrap icon in a small, subtle pill or circle background to connect with the rest of the system.

On hover of the block, you may gently increase icon glow/brightness.

Suggested semantic mapping (you choose icons):

Performance-first architecture → something like CPU / speed / spark.

Stability under peak load → shield / lock / heartbeat.

Built to scale with your roadmap → upward arrows / stack / layered squares.

3. Interaction & Motion

This section is meant to be calmer than the animated FTTB strip. Keep motion subtle:

On .cf-managed-block:hover, you may:

Lift the block slightly (1–3px translateY).

Increase border/outline brightness a bit.

Fade in a very subtle background highlight or icon glow.

Do NOT add complex looping animations here.

No marquee, no continuous motion — this is a “breather” section.

4. Harmony & Golden Ratio

Maintain vertical spacing so that:

Title → intro

Intro → grid

Blocks → next section
follow a consistent visual rhythm similar to the sections above.

Align this section’s width, padding, and max-width with the hero and Key Features for a continuous, harmonious column of content.

Use existing font sizes / weights to keep the section feeling like a native part of the design system.

5. Output

Insert the new HTML section as specified.

Add the new CSS rules at the bottom of styles.css.

Ensure the section looks visually integrated, with no collisions or regressions.

Show the diff for index.html and css/styles.css only.
